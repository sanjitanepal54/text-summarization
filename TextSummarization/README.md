# Text Summarization using from Scratch using LSTM

This project focuses on developing a text summarization system from scratch using LSTM model. The objective is to create a program that can automatically generate concise and meaningful summaries from longer texts or documents.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a text summarization system using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and using LSTM model. The system will be able to extract the most important information from a given input text and generate a condensed summary.

## Methodology

The text summarization system is developed from scratch, without relying on existing pre-trained models or libraries. The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse range of text documents or articles suitable for summarization. This dataset will be used for training and evaluation purposes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected text data. This step involves tasks such as removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing the text into sentences or words, and applying appropriate text normalization techniques.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text. Common techniques used for feature extraction in text summarization include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), and sentence embeddings.

4. **Algorithm Design**: Design a custom algorithm or approach for text summarization. This can involve various techniques, such as extractive summarization (selecting important sentences from the original text) or abstractive summarization (generating new sentences to summarize the content).

5. **Model Training**: Train the text summarization model using the prepared dataset and the selected algorithm ( here we used LSTM model). Fine-tuning or optimization steps may be required to improve the model's performance.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). Compare the generated summaries with human-written reference summaries to assess the model's effectiveness.

7. **Deployment**: Deploy the text summarization system, making it accessible for users to input their own texts and receive generated summaries.

## Getting Started

To use or build upon this text summarization system, follow these steps:

1. **Requirements**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, NLP libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy), and any other libraries or packages specific to your implementation.

2. **Data Collection**: Collect a suitable dataset of text documents or articles for training and testing the summarization system.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing it according to your chosen approach.

4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text, such as TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings.

5. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement your custom text summarization algorithm using the extracted features and any other techniques you choose to incorporate.

6. **Model Training**: Train the text summarization model using the prepared dataset and the implemented algorithm.

7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics and compare the generated summaries with reference summaries.

8. **Deployment**: Deploy the text summarization system, making it available for usage and testing.
